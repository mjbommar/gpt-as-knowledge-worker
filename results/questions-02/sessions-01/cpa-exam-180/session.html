Question: Which of the following parties may not practice before the Internal Revenue Service?
A. Attorneys
B. Certified public accountants
C. Enrolled agents
D. Non-enrolled actuaries

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Enrolled agents are the only party that are specifically designated to practice before the Internal Revenue Service, while attorneys and certified public accountants may do so but do not necessarily have a specific designation. Non-enrolled actuaries would not be allowed to practice before the IRS due to the lack of designation.

Question: Which of the following parties would not be considered a tax preparer?
A. A CPA who, for compensation, prepares all or substantially all of a tax return, but does not sign the return
B. A CPA who prepares tax returns under a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program established by the IRS
C. An accountant who, for compensation, furnishes the taxpayer with sufficient advice and information for the taxpayer to complete the return on their own in a merely clerical matter
D. An attorney who, for compensation, provides legal advice to a client on how to address a completed corporate transaction that has a significant impact on the tax return
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation: A CPA for compensation may qualify as a tax preparer as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and therefore would not be an appropriate answer. Likewise, a CPA who has prepared a tax return under the IRS&#39;s VITA program is also considered a tax preparer. An accountant who furnishes the taxpayer with only enough information to complete the return in a merely clerical matter would not be considered a tax preparer. Lastly, an attorney providing legal advice on a completed corporate transaction is not considered a tax preparer as legal advice, while related to the tax return, is not the same as preparation of the return itself.

Question: Which of the following scenarios could result in a penalty to the tax preparer?
A. The preparer takes a position with substantial authority
B. The preparer fails to perform sufficient due diligence with respect to determining eligibility to file as head of household
C. The preparer retains a copy of the tax return for a period of 3 years after the close of the return period
D. The preparer provides the taxpayer with a copy of the return at the time the taxpayer signs the return
####

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B 
Second Choice: A 
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Penalty to the tax preparer can happen if the preparer fails to perform sufficient due diligence with respect to determining eligibility to file as head of household, as stated in US Code 6695. Retaining a copy and providing a copy are not violations that would result in a penalty and taking a position with substantial authority is not necessarily a violation, though it could result in a penalty in some cases.

Question: Which professional body can grant or revoke a CPA’s license?
A. American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
B. National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA)
C. The relevant State Board of Accountancy
D. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: A CPA’s license is granted or revoked by the relevant State Board of Accountancy, not the AICPA, NASBA, or FASB. The AICPA discusses the qualifications for and regulation of CPAs, but it does not award or revoke licenses. NASBA acts as a liaison between the state boards of accountancy and the AICPA and facilitates the CPA exam but does not grant or revoke licenses. The FASB does not deal with any aspect of the process associated with granting or revoking CPA licenses.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: A is the correct choice because the taxpayer can appeal their case administratively within the IRS. B and C are incorrect because U.S. Court of Federal Claims and U.S. Tax Court are incorrect venues for appeals.

Question: Which of the following is a true statement regarding the US Tax Court?
A. The Court can issue summary decisions, regular decisions, and memorandum decisions
B. Taxpayers are required to pay the disputed tax prior to the Court hearing the case
C. Jury trials are available if requested
D. The Court’s decisions are always considered precedent

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Option A is true, as the Tax Court can issue Summary Decisions, Regular Decisions and Memorandum Decisions. Option B, requiring taxpayers to pay the disputed tax prior to the Court hearing the case, is false. Taxpayers can enter into an agreement with the IRS for payment of a portion of the disputed tax prior to the court hearing the case, but this is not mandatory. Option C, jury trials being available, is also false, as jury trials are not available in the Tax Court. Option D, the Court&#39;s decisions being considered precedent, is false. The Tax Court&#39;s decisions are considered persuasive, but not necessarily binding.

Question: At which level of confidence is the disclosure of a tax position required in order to avoid penalties?
A. Substantial authority
B. More likely than not
C. Reasonable basis
D. Frivolous

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Internal Revenue Code Section 6662 requires that the disclosure of a tax position must be more likely than not (B) in order for a taxpayer to avoid penalties. Reasonable basis (C) requires a lower standard and may be sufficient for avoiding certain penalties; however, this would not be sufficient to avoid all penalties. The substantial authority (A) standard is higher than the more likely than not standard and thus is not sufficient to avoid penalties. Frivolous (D) would not be sufficient to avoid penalties.

Question: Which of the following statements regarding accuracy-related taxpayer penalties is correct?
A. A substantial understatement penalty applies if the tax liability is understated by the greater of 20% of the correct tax or $5,000
B. Claiming a §199A Qualified Business Deduction reduces the threshold at which a substantial understatement penalty applies
C. The IRS charges interest on the underpayment, but not on the penalty
D. Failure to keep records supporting the qualification of credits claimed is not an example of negligence

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: A is correct because a substantial understatement penalty applies when the tax liability is understated by the greater of 20% of the correct tax or $5,000. B is incorrect because claiming a §199A Qualified Business Deduction does not reduce the threshold at which a substantial understatement penalty applies. C is correct because the IRS does not charge interest on the penalty for an underpayment, only on the underpayment itself. D is incorrect because failure to keep records supporting the qualifications of credits claimed is an example of negligence.

Question: Which of the following shows the correct hierarchy of authority for federal tax purposes, from highest authority to lowest?
A. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, U.S. Tax Court, Revenue Rulings

Second Choice: B 
Third Choice: C 
Explanation: The Internal Revenue Code is the highest authority for federal tax issues; Revenue Rulings are a set of guidelines issued by the IRS that interpret the Code; Treasury Regulations provide more in-depth explanations of the Internal Revenue Code; and U.S. Tax Court decisions are rulings made by the court that clarify laws and regulations. Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.

Question: A tax return preparer has which of the following obligations to their client?:
A. To minimize the client’s taxes by any means

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Choice B is the most likely answer because it requires that the tax return preparer use ethical and legal means to minimize their client&#39;s taxes. Choice C is less likely because it requires the most conservative approach but may not be ethical depending on the situation. Choice D is incorrect because the preparer should not sign a return they know to be materially incorrect.

Question: Which statement most accurately reflects privileged communications as they relate to tax matters?
A. Federal law generally does not recognize accountant-client privilege, but a limited number of states do
B. Federal law generally does not recognize accountant-client privilege, but nearly all states do
C. Federal law does generally recognize accountant-client privilege, without exception
D. Federal law does generally recognize accountant-client privilege, but only with respect to workpapers

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Federal law does generally recognize accountant-client privilege, without exception, through promulgation of the rules of evidence in Federal Rule of Evidence 501. Therefore, choice C is the most likely correct answer. Choices A and D are less likely correct because they contain exceptions, which is contrary to the language of the rule.

Question: All of the following are ways in which agency power can arise, except:
A. Actual authority
B. Apparent authority
C. Ratification by a disclosed principal
D. Ratification by an undisclosed principal
####

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Actual authority is created through express words or overt actions of the principal. Apparent authority is created when a principal holds out another as having authority to act on its behalf. Ratification by a disclosed principal is a situation in which the principal adopts or confirms actions taken by an agent on its behalf that the agent was not authorized to take. Ratification by an undisclosed principal is not a valid way for agency power to arise because an undisclosed principal cannot take action to ratify an act.

Question: Which of the following is not a duty an agent owes to a principal?
A. Duties expressly stated in the contract
B. Duty of capacity
C. Duties of obedience
D. Duty of loyalty
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: An agent&#39;s duties to the principal include duties of loyalty, obedience, diligence, and care. Duty of loyalty means that the agent must act in the best interest of the principal, and not their own interests. Duty of obedience means that the agent must comply with lawful instructions given by the principal, while diligence and care refer to the standard of care and attention that the agent must uphold, meeting a reasonable standard of care and diligence. Duty of capacity is not included as a duty an agent owes to a principal as it relates to the legal capacity or competency of the agent.

Question: Which of the following types of contract does not require a written element in order to be enforceable?
A. Contracts for the sale of goods for $500 or more
B. Contracts to act as surety
C. Contracts for the sale of a house
D. Contracts for leases of land for less than one year

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) requires that orders for goods of $500 or more must be in writing in order to be enforceable, thus Choice A is incorrect. However, contracts for leases of land for less than one year do not need to be in writing in order to be enforceable, making Choice D the best option. Choice B and Choice C need not be in writing in order to be enforceable, but Choice D is a better option than the other two choices.

Question: Which of the following is not a permissible condition for payment?
A. Condition precedent
B. Condition concurrent
C. Condition consecutive
D. Condition subsequent
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: B
Explanation: A condition precedent is one that must occur in order for a payment to be made, while a condition concurrent is one that must occur simultaneously with the payment. A condition consecutive is when the payment must occur after the fulfillment of the contractual term, and a condition subsequent is when the payment is made contingent on a future event that could potentially act as a defense of the payment. Among these, condition subsequent is not a permissible condition for payment.

Question: Which of the following is not a possible form of remedy to which the nonbreaching party could be entitled?
A. Consequential damages as a result of the breach
B. Punitive damages for a fraudulent act
C. Rescission of the contract
D. Specific performance for personal services
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D 
Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C 
Explanation: Consequential and punitive damages may be awarded if the non-breaching party is able to prove that they&#39;ve suffered as a result of the other&#39;s breach of contract. Rescission of the contract imposes liability on the breaching party to return all consideration received and restore the non-breaching party to its pre-contract status. Specific performance is an equitable remedy awarded when a breach of contract cannot be adequately or fairly remedied with an award of money damages; it requires the breaching party to fulfill the contract’s terms as originally agreed upon. However, specific performance cannot be applied to contracts for personal services, hence choice D is the correct answer.

Third Choice: D
Explanation: Right I is not included in any of the choices, and it is not a right that a surety has. Right II and Right III are included in both choices B and C, while Right IV is only included in C, so C is most likely the correct answer as it has the most rights included of the answer choices.

Question: Which of the following is an instance in which unsecured creditors could petition into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings?
A. There are 3 creditors, with one owed $20,000

C. The debtor is a farmer
D. The debtor owes $100,000 to the creditors, but is generally paying debts as due

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: D is the best choice because an instance in which unsecured creditors may petition into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings is typically the case of unpaid debts - in this case the debtor owes $100,000 to the creditors but is not paying the debts. A is incorrect because it does not specify the amount of the debt owed. B is incorrect because filing a lien in the public record does not initiate an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding.

Question: Which of the following scenarios would result in an effective attachment?
Scenario I. The debtor has rights in the collateral
Scenario II. The debtor has received value in exchange for the security interest
Scenario III. The debtor and creditor have a record of the security agreement authenticated by the creditor

A. I, II, and III
B. I, II, and IV
C. I, III, and IV
D. II, III, and IV

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Scenario I is required for attachment for a security interest, meaning that choice A and C are incorrect. Scenario II is required for perfection, and Scenario IV is additional evidence of the attachment, meaning that choice B and D are correct. Choice B is most likely correct as it contains both requirements for attachment and perfection, whereas Choice D only contains the requirement for perfection.

Explanation: A valid means of perfecting a security interest is through possession of pledged tangible property, through filing a financing statement or through automatic perfection for a purchase money security interest in inventory. Control over certificated securities in bearer form, however, is not a valid means of perfecting a security interest, so it is the least likely choice among the given options.

Question: An employee’s _________ are subject to FICA; the _________ is responsible for withholding and remitting the employee’s portion of the taxes. A self-employed taxpayer’s ___________ is subject to FICA.

Which of the following options correctly answers all of the blanks in the sentences above?
A. Gross wages; employee; net profits
B. After-tax wages; employer; net profits
C. Gross wages; employer; gross profits
D. Gross wages; employer; net profits

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Gross wages are always subject to FICA and the employer is responsible for withholding and remitting the employee’s portion of the taxes. Self-employed taxpayers are taxed on net profits, not gross profits, so option D is the best choice. Option C is incorrect because self-employed taxpayers are taxed on net, not gross, profits. Option A is incorrect because after-tax wages are not subject to FICA taxes.

Choice D is also correct as in a manager-managed LLC members have the power to bind the LLC.

Question: If a purchasing relative sells the acquired property at a price that exceeds the original relative’s basis, the purchasing relative recognizes:
A. No gain or loss
B. A gain to the extent that the sale price exceeds the original relative’s basis

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: The purchasing relative’s basis in the acquired property is the original relative’s basis. Therefore, A is incorrect because the sale price exceeds the original relative’s basis and the purchasing relative will recognize a gain. B is the best answer because it states that the gain is to the extent that the sale price exceeds the original relative’s basis. C is incorrect because the purchasing relative’s basis is the original relative’s basis, not its purchase price. D is incorrect because the original relative’s basis is less than the purchasing relative’s purchase price.

Explanation: A cash gift given to a friend to pay for medical expenses would qualify for the current annual gift exclusion, and gifting a new car to a grandchild would also qualify. A beach house given to a child upon successful completion of an accredited university would not qualify, as it is not considered a current gift. A bond given to a sibling would not qualify, as the bond matures in 20 years and thus the gift is not immediate.

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: A is correct because it requires both scenarios I and III, which are the necessary conditions to deduct the real estate activity losses against other income. B is incorrect because it allows for only one of the two conditions (either I or III) to be met. Similarly, C is is incorrect because it requires only scenario II, which does not allow for the taxpayer to fully deduct their rental activity losses against other income.

Question: Which of the following is a requirement for a taxpayer being an eligible “surviving spouse?
A. The taxpayer’s spouse died during the current tax year
B. The taxpayer has no dependents
C. The taxpayer has not remarried prior to the close of the current tax year
D. The taxpayer could not have filed a joint return with the deceased spouse during the year in which the spouse died

Second Choice: D 
Third Choice: A
Explanation: According to IRS Publication 559 - Survivors, Executors, and Administrators (2020), in order to qualify as an eligible surviving spouse under the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer must not have remarried prior to the close of the current tax year. Choice C is the correct answer. Choice A is incorrect as the status of a surviving spouse is not dependent on when an individual&#39;s spouse died. Choice B is also incorrect as a taxpayer can still be considered an eligible surviving spouse if they have dependent children. Choice D is incorrect as the requirements for filing a joint return with a deceased spouse are different than the requirements for eligible surviving spouse status.

Question: A taxpayer will be ineligible to claim a full dependency for an:
A. Otherwise qualifying child who dies during the year
B. Otherwise qualifying relative who is a resident of Canada

D. Otherwise qualifying relative child who turns 21 during the year and is a full-time student

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: B
Explanation: A taxpayer will be ineligible to claim a full dependency for an otherwise qualifying child who dies during the year, as a qualifying child must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half of the taxable year. Otherwise qualifying relative child who turns 21 during the year and is a full-time student can still be claimed as a qualifying person by the taxpayer according to the definition. A otherwise qualifying relative who is a resident of Canada does not meet the definition for a dependent in the Internal Revenue Code, so the taxpayer cannot claim a full dependency for that person.

Question: In which of the following scenarios could a taxpayer be subject to penalties for failure to pay estimated taxes?
A. The taxpayer’s W-2 withholding is equal to 90% of the taxpayer’s current year tax
B. The taxpayer’s W-2 withholding is equal to 110% of the taxpayer’s prior year tax
C. The taxpayer made no estimated payments and has $500 of tax due at the time of filing for the current year
D. The taxpayer’s W-2 withholding is equal to 75% of the current year tax and prior year taxes and the balance due at the time of filing is $1,500.

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: As per the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, taxpayers must make estimated tax payments if their tax liability is more than $1,000 and exceeds their withholding. Therefore, choice C is most likely as the taxpayer made no estimated payments and has $500 of tax due - this exceeds the $1,000 threshold. Choice D is also likely as the taxpayer’s W-2 withholding is equal to 75% of the current year tax and prior year taxes and the balance due at the time of filing is $1,500, which exceeds the $1,000 threshold. Choice A is incorrect, as the taxpayer’s W-2 withholding is equal to 90% of the current year tax and this would not be enough to cover the taxpayer’s tax liability for the year.

Question: Which of the following is required for a group of corporations to file a consolidated return?
A. All of the corporations were members of the affiliated group during the tax year
B. One of the corporations is an S corporation
C. At least ⅔ of the members of the affiliated group consent to the consolidated return filing
D. If the corporations are owned by an individual, they hold at least 80% or more of the value of all outstanding stock of each corporation

Second Choice: C 
Third Choice: D 
Explanation: A is required for a group of corporations to file a consolidated return because in order to form a parent-subsidiary consolidated group, all member corporations must have been members of the affiliated group throughout the tax year (Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) §1563). C is less likely as the regulations require at least 2/3 of the members of the affiliated group to consent to the consolidated return filing (IRC §1561 ). D is also less likely as if the corporations are owned by an individual, they must hold at least 80% of the value of all outstanding stock in order to become a majority-owned group under IRC §1563(a).

Question: What does nexus establish within the context of a company’s multi-jurisdictional transaction for tax purposes?
A. The physical and/or economic presence within a jurisdiction that subjects the company to the jurisdiction’s taxing authority

Third Choice: C
Explanation: Nexus establishes the physical and/or economic presence within a jurisdiction for a company’s multi-jurisdictional transactions, which in turn subjects the company to the jurisdiction’s taxing authority (Option A). Options B and C do not accurately describe the concept of nexus in the context of tax purposes. Option D is inaccurate as it refers to generally accepted accounting principles, which are not related to nexus.

Question: Which of the following statements about foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries with respect to federal taxation to a US company is correct?
A. A foreign branch is never treated as a separate legal entity
B. A foreign branch’s income does not qualify for the reduced tax rate applicable to certain foreign-derived income
C. A foreign subsidiary and a foreign branch are treated the same for all federal tax purposes
D. A foreign subsidiary is always disregarded for income tax purposes

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Choice A is correct because a foreign branch is not treated as a separate legal entity; the branch&#39;s income and assets are attributed directly to its parent for the purpose of determining tax liabilities. Choice B is correct because only income earned from a foreign subsidiary will qualify for the reduced foreign-derived income tax rate. Choice C is incorrect because a foreign subsidiary will be treated as its own separate entity and therefore be subject to the full corporate income tax rate, while income earned by the parents through a foreign branch will not. Choice D is incorrect because the IRS does not generally disregard income earned by a foreign subsidiary, it is instead subject to the full corporate income tax rate.

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Gross income from rental income on a warehouse located in Germany (Choice D) is foreign-source income and does not qualify for foreign tax credits. Gains, profits, and income from the disposition of an interest in real property located in the US Virgin Islands (Choice B) is not included in foreign-source income because it is located in the US. Underwriting income derived from the reinsurance of a property insurance contract in connection with property in the US (Choice C) is also US-source income and ineligible for the foreign tax credit.

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Payment of qualified scholarships are not subject to withholding for federal tax purposes, per § 1.1441–1(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  Gross investments income from dividends paid to a foreign private foundation would be subject to withholding because there is no exemption under the IRC. Wages paid to a nonresident alien would also be subject to withholding, as stated in § 3401(a) of the IRC and CFR §§ 31.3402(h)–2 and 31.3402(s)–2. In addition, distributions of effectively connected income to foreign partnerships by publicly traded partnerships are subject to withholding taxes per § 1446(f) of the IRC and CFR § 1.1446–4.

Question: Fill in the blank for the following sentence:
A controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment amount is based on the average quarterly basis in _________ used in a trade or business for the production of tested income:
A. Amortizable intangible assets
B. Depreciable tangible property
C. Capitalized real property
D. Leased personal property
####

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: The qualified business asset investment amount is based off of the average quarterly basis used for depreciable tangible property. Generally, depreciable tangible property includes any tangible property that has a useful life greater than one year and is used in a trade or business for the production of tested income. Leased personal property does not produce tested income. Amortizable intangible assets and capitalized real property would not be included in the qualified business asset investment amount.

Question: What is the consequence of a partnership filing a Section §754 election?
A. It results in an immediate gain on a partner’s capital interest acquired for services rendered
B. It allows the partnership to push audit adjustments to partners, rather than paying imputed adjustments at the partnership level
C. It allows the partnership to adjust the basis of the property within a partnership when a triggering event occurs
D. The partnership may deduct up to $5,000 start-up expenses, rather than capitalize them

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: The Section §754 election allows the partnership to push audit adjustments to the individual partners rather than applying them at the partnership level (Choice B). Choice C is incorrect because the §754 election does not adjust the basis of the property within a partnership when a triggering event occurs. Choice A is incorrect because this election does not result in an immediate gain on a partner’s capital interest acquired for services rendered. Choice D is incorrect because the §754 election does not allow a partnership to deduct up to $5,000 in start-up expenses.

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: A limited liability company (LLC) is its own separate entity, distinct from its owners. It may elect to be taxed as a disregarded entity, partnership, or corporation. A trust is not included amongst these options as it is its own type of entity and is not eligible for LLC tax treatment.

Explanation: A horticultural organization and a fraternal beneficiary society are both organizations that may qualify as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3). However, civic organizations that support political campaigns and professional sports leagues do not qualify for 501(c)(3) status as these organizations are not &#34;charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, or preventing cruelty to children or animals.&#34;[1]

Explanation: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) developed the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. This document serves as the basis for financial accounting standards. The purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the FASB in developing and improving financial reporting standards. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is the professional organization that sets ethics and continuing education standards for CPAs, while the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) is the organization that administers regulations and sets auditing standards for public companies. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) sets International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for companies operating internationally.

Question: Which of the following methods is an acceptable method to record the acquisition of a subsidiary?
A. Equity method
B. Cost method
C. Pooling of interests method
D. Par value method
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: A
Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: The Equity Method is an acceptable method to record the acquisition of a subsidiary because it represents the parent’s equity stake in the subsidiary and recognizes any differences between the cost of the acquired assets and the parent’s equity stake. The cost method is an acceptable method, but it does not recognize the parent’s equity stake in the subsidiary. The Pooling of Interests method is not an acceptable method to record the acquisition of a subsidiary since it was eliminated in 2001 by the FASB. Similarly, the Par Value Method is not an acceptable method to record the acquisition of a subsidiary since it was eliminated in the 1970s.

A. Reconciliation of operating cash flows is required if the direct method is used
B. The typical classifications are operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities
C. The indirect method is allowed, but not required
D. Cash received from donors with a requirement to use for endowment funds is reported as a financing activity

Explanation: The indirect method is allowed but not required for not-for-profit, non-governmental entities. Statement D is incorrect because cash received from donors with a requirement to use for endowment funds is typically reported as investing activities and not financing activities. Statement A is incorrect because while reconciliation of operating cash flows is preferred, it is not actually required if the direct method is used.

Second Choice: A 
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Form 10K is an annual report required by the Securities Exchange Commission that provides a comprehensive summary of a company’s financial performance and is presented to security holders and the SEC. Items required to be reported in a 10K include material facts that impact the company’s securities and financial statements, but does not include compiled financial statements or a requirement to file quarterly. A change in the board of directors does not require a 10K to be filed, though it should be reported in the 10K.

Question: Defined benefit plans that present information in accordance with FASB ASC 960 are not required to include which of the following in their financial statements?
A. Statement of cash flows
B. Statement of net assets available for benefits as of the end of the plan year
C. Statement of changes in net assets available for benefits during the current plan year
D. Actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits as of the beginning or end of the plan year

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: C
Explanation: A is the correct choice because FASB ASC 960 does not require that a statement of cash flows be included in the financial statements for defined benefit plans; B and C are incorrect because the ASC does require that a statement of net assets available for benefits and a statement of changes in net assets available for benefits both be included in the financial statements. D is incorrect because the ASC requires either the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits at the beginning or the end of the plan year to be included.

Question: Which of the following frameworks is not considered to be a special purpose framework for the basis of accounting?
A. Cash basis
B. International Financial Reporting Standards
C. Tax basis
D. Contractual basis
####

        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Cash basis and tax basis are considered special purpose frameworks, specifically designed to prioritize information from a certain perspective. Contractual basis is also a recognized special purpose framework, designed to include the explicit financial statements required for parties to a contract. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), on the other hand, is a comprehensive framework, meaning it is meant to provide robust information to financial statement users.

Question: All of the following investment types require or allow the use of fair value measurement in financial statements, except:
A. Hybrid financial instruments
B. Derivatives
C. Goodwill
D. Held-to-maturity debt securities
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: C
Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Goods are not valued with fair value under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Derivatives and hybrid financial instruments, on the other hand, may require fair value measurements if specific characteristics are present under GAAP. Held-to-maturity debt securities are investments that are not normally reported on the balance sheet at fair value because they are held to maturity and are not revalued over time.

Question: Which of the following types of investments cannot be accounted for using the equity method?
A. An investment in which the investor directly holds a controlling financial interest in the investee
B. Common stock held by an estate
C. An investment in which the investor exercises significant influence over the investee
D. A general partnership interest
####

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: C
Explanation: The equity method can be used to account for investments in common stock or investments in which the investor exercises significant influence (Options A and C). It cannot be used for general partnership interests (Option D). In the case of an estate, no equity method is applicable, since the FASB doesn&#39;t allow the use of this method when it comes to estate holding stock (Option B).

Question: A company could use any of the following factors to consider whether the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, except:
A. Declining cash flows
B. Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions
C. Decreasing cost of raw materials
D. Increased competitive environment
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: C
Second Choice: D 
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the reputation and customer base of a company. The fair value of goodwill is typically determined using an income approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis. Therefore, factors such as cash flow, macroeconomic conditions, and the competitive environment are relevant. The cost of raw materials typically does not affect the company&#39;s reputation or customer base, so it would not be considered when valuing goodwill.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Troubled debt restructuring occurs when a lender renegotiates the terms of a loan agreement to give a struggling borrower a second chance to pay off the debt. Both Condition I and II must be true for a change to a debt instrument to be considered troubled debt restructuring. The lender must grant a concession to the borrower and the borrower must experience financial difficulty.

Question: Which of the following is not a criteria that must be met in order for revenue to be recognized?
A. A contractual obligation exists
B. The payment terms for services or goods to be transferred can be identified
C. The contract does not have commercial substance
D. It is probable that substantially all of the consideration will be collected

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Revenue recognition is generally accepted to occur when a contractual obligation is present, payment terms are identifiable, and the contract has commercial substance. It is also likely that substantially all of the consideration will be collected. However, the presence of all four criteria is not required for revenue recognition. Choice C is incorrect because for revenue recognition, the contract must have commercial substance.

Third Choice: B
Explanation: D is not correct with respect to compensatory stock options because the grant date is the date on which the options are approved or granted, rather than issued. A is correct because the compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of the options. B is correct because the options can be valued using the fair value of the options or the market value of the underlying stock.

Question: Which of the following is not an example of an uncertain tax position?
A. A corporation decides not to register and remit sales taxes in a particular state
B. A corporation characterizes certain employee’s wages as 100% research and development for the purposes of the R&amp;D Tax credit.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: An uncertain tax position exists when there is lack of clarity regarding the expected outcome of a tax position, as judged by the taxpayer. A corporation deciding not to register and remit sales taxes in a particular state (A) and characterizing certain employees&#39; wages as 100% research and development for the purposes of the R&amp;D Tax credit (B) includes elements of uncertain tax positions. In contrast, implementing a transfer pricing regime (C) and excluding a foreign entity from the US tax return (D) involve definitive decisions, and therefore should not be considered uncertain tax positions.

Question: A loss contingency must be disclosed, but not accrued if:
A. The loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: A is most likely the correct answer, as the FASB Accounting Standards Codification states that a loss contingency must be disclosed if the event is probable, and is either estimable or not estimable (FASB ASC 450-20-25-1). B is also a possible answer because loss contingencies must be disclosed even if the amount cannot be estimated. C is incorrect because loss contingencies must be disclosed regardless of the probability of the event (FASB ASC 450-20-25-4).

Question: Which of the following is not an example of a potential embedded derivative in a debt instrument?
A. Host contract
B. Conversion option
C. Put option
D. Interest rate leverage

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Embedded derivatives are features of a debt or equity instrument that have separate economic characteristics from the underlying financial instrument. Embedded derivatives are often hidden within an issuer&#39;s debt instruments and may include conversion options, put options, interest rate leverage and call options. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Host contract.

Question: The gain or loss on  _________ would be reported in other comprehensive income:
A. A fair value hedge

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: C
Explanation: A fair value hedge is used to hedge an asset or liability and would always be reported in profit or loss so Choice A is not the best choice. Choices D and B both involve hedges with foreign currency which would be reported in other comprehensive income so these are the more likely choices. Choice D is the more likely of the two as it is specifically a fair value hedge. Choice C deals with the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge, but this portion would still be reported in profit or loss, making it the least likely option.

Question: Which of the following is not included in the lessee’s calculation of the aggregate lease payment amount?
A. Fixed payments, less any incentives paid or payable to the lessee
B. Indexed variable lease payments
C. Fees paid by the lessee to the owners of a special-purpose entity for structuring the transaction
D. The entire potential payment amount that the lessee could owe under a residual value guarantee

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: C
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The lessee&#39;s calculation of the aggregate lease payment amount should include fixed payments, less any incentives paid or payable to the lessee (A) and any indexed variable lease payments (B). The potential payment amount that the lessee could owe under a residual value guarantee (D) should also be included in the calculation as a potential cost, but not necessarily a set lease payment amount, which is why it is not included in the first three choices. Fees paid to the owners of a special-purpose entity for structuring the transaction (C) is unrelated to the aggregate lease payments, and would not be included in the lessee&#39;s calculation of the aggregate lease payment amount.

Question: Which of the following factors, if present in a lease, would require a lessee to classify a lease as a finance lease?
Factor I. The ownership of the underlying asset transfers to the lessee by the end of the lease term
Factor II. The lessee is granted the option to purchase the underlying asset and is reasonably certain to do so
Factor III. The lease term is for a major portion of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset
Factor IV. The present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee not already included in the lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset
A. None
B. Any of Factors I, II, III, or IV
C. All of Factors I, II, III, and IV
D. Only Factor IV

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Factor I, II, III, and IV all provide reasons to classify a lease as a finance lease. Factor I notes that the ownership of the underlying asset transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term. Factor II states that the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset and is reasonably certain to do so. Factor III states that the lease must extend for a major portion of the residual economic life of the underlying asset. Lastly, Factor IV states that the present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residuals value guaranteed by the lessee not already included in the lease payments, is substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. Therefore, B is the most likely choice since it notes that any of the factors I, II, III, or IV could require a lessee to classify a lease as a finance lease. C is also correct, since all of the listed factors will cause a lease to be classified as a finance lease. However, D is incorrect, since only Factor IV would categorize the lease as a finance lease.

Question: A not-for-profit entity recognizes unrestricted support at the time a contribution is received for which of the following types of contributions?:

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Unrestricted unconditional contributions should be recognized at the time of receipt, so choice A is incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because restricted unconditional contributions are only recognized when the donor&#39;s conditional stipulations are met. Choice C is correct because unrestricted conditional contributions should be recognized when the donor&#39;s conditional stipulations are met. Choice D is incorrect because restricted conditional contributions should not be recognized until the conditions are met.

Question: Which of the following activities would not be considered research and development?
A. Adaptation of an existing capability to meet a customer’s requirement as part of ongoing commercial activity
B. Design, construction, and testing of pre-production models and prototypes
C. Evaluation of product or process alternatives

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Research and development generally involves original investigation for the purpose of creating a new product, process, or service (AICPA, 2020). Adaptation of existing capabilities to meet customer requirements (A), design and construction testing of pre-production models (B), and engineering activities required to advance the design of a product (D) would all be considered research and development activities. Evaluation of product or process alternatives (C) would not qualify as research and development because the activity involves analysis of different alternatives rather than creating something new.

Second Choice: B 
Third Choice: A 
Explanation: Statement I is correct as recognized subsequent events provide additional information about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. Statement II is also correct as nonrecognized subsequent events provide additional information about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date. Statement III is also correct as the financial impact of recognized subsequent events must be recognized in the financial statements. However, Statement IV is incorrect as nonrecognized events must still be disclosed if material. Therefore, option C is the best choice with B in second and A in third place.

Question: Which of the following is the highest level of the input hierarchy for fair value measurement?

Third Choice: C
Explanation: When measuring fair value, the highest of the three levels in the input hierarchy is observable inputs from active markets (Choice B). Non-quoted observable inputs (Choice A) and unobservable inputs (Choice C) are located lower in the hierarchy because they may not correspond with active market prices. The level of non-active market comparables (Choice D) is not included in the fair value input hierarchy.

B. Accrual basis
C. Modified accrual basis
D. Full accrual basis

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: The basis of state and local government accounting is governed by Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards. GASB recommends that state and local governments use the modified accrual basis of accounting, with some transactions (like investments) reflecting an accrual basis of accounting. Choice A does not reflect this, as it does not conform to GASB standards, and Choice B is also incorrect as it does not reflect all transactions appropriately.

Question: Which of the following is different in state and local government accounting from full accrual basis?
A. Timing of expenses
B. Timing of revenue
C. Discounting of cashflows
D. Cost of capital assets
####

        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: State and local governments do not use full accrual basis, but instead use a modified basis. While all four options do have differences between state/local government accounting and full accrual basis, the most significant difference is the timing of revenue, as revenue is mainly recognized through a cash basis or modified accrual basis. Discounting of cashflows, cost of capital assets, and timing of expenses can all be accounted for differently between the two methods, but the recognition of revenues is the main difference.

Question: Which of the following is not produced by state and local governments as part of their basic financial statement and required supplementary information?
A. Statement of net assets
B. Statement of activities
C. Statement of accountability
D. Management’s discussion and analysis
####

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: The basic financial statements of state and local governments typically include a statement of net assets, a statement of activities and a statement of accountability. Management&#39;s discussion and analysis is not typically included as part of the basic financial statements, as it is not an essential element or part of the required supplementary information.

Question: Governmental fund financial statements are produced using the:
A. Modified accrual resource measurement focus
B. Current accrual resource measurement focus
C. Current financial resources measurement focus
D. Economic resources measurement focus
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Government fund financial statements are to be prepared using the current accrual resource measurement focus. Under this approach, outflows and inflows are to be reported when they are measurable and available. For example, when property taxes are due and receivable, they must be claimed as a receivable and not when they are collected as in the modified accrual approach. Moreover, the economic resources measurement focus is used for proprietary funds.

Question: Proprietary fund reporting statements prepared by state and local governments should include which of the following:
A. Funds associated with multi-year road maintenance
B. Funds associated with servicing a 30-year bond
C. Funds associated with a municipal utility
D. Funds associated with a public employee pension plan

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Proprietary funds are designed to report activities of a state or local government that function similarly to a private entity. Therefore, answers A, B, and C all pertain to activities of a state or local government that should be reported as proprietary funds. Answer D, on the other hand, relates to activities of a state or local government that should be reported in other authorities such as a fiduciary fund, causing it to be the least likely answer.

Question: Fiduciary fund reporting statements prepared by state and local governments should include which of the following:
A. Funds associated with multi-year road maintenance
B. Funds associated with servicing a 30-year bond
C. Funds associated with a municipal utility
D. Funds associated with a public employee pension plan

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Fiduciary fund reporting statements are used in state and local government for funds held for other parties such as other governments, individuals, private organizations, and employees. As such, the most likely choices for these statements are those items related to funds held in trust by the state or local government which are C (funds associated with a municipal utility) and D (funds associated with a public employee pension plan). Multi-year road maintenance (A) and servicing a 30-year bond (B) are not related to money held in trust are thus less likely.

Question: State and local governments are not required to disclose which of the following information in the notes to the financial statements?
A. The method of accounting for encumbrances
B. Descriptions of the activities accounted for in the major funds, internal service funds, and fiduciary funds
C. Actions taken to correct material or significant non-compliance with legal or contractual financial compliance

Explanation: The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) does not require state and local governments to disclose information about encumbrances, descriptions, and legal or contractual financial compliance in the notes to the financial statements. Furthermore, GASB Statement No. 33, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Nonexchange Transactions, requires that available resources are reported when applicable as long as all transactions are properly recognized, therefore disclosure of the length of time used to define “available” is not required.

Question: Which of the following is not included in state and local governments’ supplementary budgetary comparison schedule?:
A. Original budget
B. Final budget
C. Actual amounts
D. Variances between final and actual budgets

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation: A supplementary budgetary comparison schedule is used to compare the original budget to the final budget, and to track the variances between the two. Therefore, Option D is not included in a supplementary budgetary comparison schedule and is the best answer. Option A is also correct since original budget amounts are compared to the final budget amounts on the schedule, and Option C is incorrect since actual amounts are being compared to the final budget on the schedule.

Explanation: The blended presentation method is to be used when a component unit serves the primary government exclusively or almost exclusively and the governing body of the component unit is either the same as or substantially the same as the governing body of the primary government (GASB 34, para. 13). This means that both Condition I and Condition II must be satisfied to utilize the blended presentation method.

Question: Where should special items be reported on state and local governments’ financial statements?
A. Only disclosed in the notes
B. Reported separately in the statement of activities, after extraordinary items
C. Reported separately in the statement of activities, before extraordinary items
D. Reported in the primary government section of the statement of activities

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: A
Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Special items should only be disclosed in the notes section of a state and local government&#39;s financial statement. Special items are items that are unique, material, and infrequently occurrences, and as such are typically only provided in the footnotes with further details about the item (AICPA, 2020). B and C are incorrect because reporting special items separate from the other activities offers less detail than is needed and would make it difficult to get an accurate picture of how the overall financial performance is.

Explanation: A is incorrect because it is a required reporting requirement for financial audits under Government Accountability Office Government Auditing Standards. B is incorrect because a written report on the auditor&#39;s understanding of internal controls must be included regardless of the presence of significant deficiencies. D is incorrect because it is a required reporting requirement for financial audits under Government Accountability Office Government Auditing Standards. C is correct because it is not a required reporting requirement for financial audits under Government Accountability Office Government Auditing Standards, as the emphasis is instead on identifying any important information that the auditor omitted.

Explanation: Choice D involves a familiarity threat given the direct relationship between the partner&#39;s child and the client. Choice A does not create a familiarity threat, as the partner does not know what investments are in the blind trust. Choice B creates an economic threat because the associate has a direct economic interest in an entity connected to the client.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The PCAOB has adopted interim ethics standards based on SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 2-01. This rule requires a public company’s auditor to be independent in order to protect the integrity and objectivity of the information provided by the auditor. AICPA&#39;s Code of Professional Conduct Rules 101 and 102 are related to ethical obligations of CPAs, but do not address independence. The Independence Standards Board sets independence standards for non-public companies, but does not set the particular standards adopted by the PCAOB.

Question: Which of the following situations would not present a threat to an auditor’s or accounting firm’s ethical requirements of the PCAOB?
A. An audit partner serves on the board of directors of a nonprofit social club that is an audit client
B. The firm’s consulting branch provides transaction consulting services with a contingent fee to an audit client

Second Choice: A 
Third Choice: B 
Explanation: Option A is not a threat as an auditor or accounting firm may serve on the board of directors of a nonprofit social club that is an audit client, provided there is no conflict of interest. Option B presents a threat because offering transaction consulting services with a contingent fee to an audit client may impair the auditor’s objectivity. Option C is not a threat because being a member of a trade association that is a client of the firm does not present a conflict of interest. Option D presents a threat as the tax partner providing personal financial planning services to a client and suggesting an investment in a business in which the partner has a financial interest may lead to a conflict of interest.

Question: In which of the following situations would an accountant be considered independent with respect to the employee benefit plan that they audit for the Department of Labor?
Situation I. The accountant’s firm had a direct material interest in the plan sponsor
Situation II. A partner of the accountant’s firm serves as a voting trustee of the plan
Situation III. Another member of the accountant’s firm maintains financial records for the plan
A. None
B. Situation II only
C. Situation III only
D. Situations I and II

Second Choice: C 
Third Choice: D
Explanation: An accountant is considered to be independent with respect to an audit performed for the Department of Labor when they have no direct material interest in the plan sponsor and do not serve as voting trustees of the plan. Since Situation I indicates the accountant&#39;s firm has a direct material interest in the plan sponsor and Situation II indicates a partner of the accountant&#39;s firm serves as a voting trustee, both of these situations would make the accountant not independent. Situation III, on the other hand, would not make the accountant not independent in this scenario as maintaining financial records for the plan does not necessarily necessitate a lack of independence.

Question: Which of the following is an accurate statement regarding professional skepticism?
A. It only needs to be exercised at the start of the audit.
B. It assumes that management is dishonest.
C. It requires the auditor to consider the competency and sufficiency of evidence
D. It is in direct opposition with due care
####

        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: C
Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Professional skepticism is an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence. It requires the auditor to remain diligent throughout the entire audit process, not just at the start. Professional skepticism does not assume that management is dishonest, and it does not necessarily oppose due care.

Question: Which of the following is not a threat or impediment to acting with professional skepticism?
A. Motivated reasoning
B. Source credibility bias
C. Deadline pressure
D. Quality control reviews
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Motivated reasoning and source credibility bias are both threats to or impediments to acting with professional skepticism as they are cognitive tendencies that lead a person to interpret evidence or statements in an biased or irrational way. Deadline pressure is also not conductive to professional skepticism as it could lead to cutting corners and making decisions without considering sufficient evidence. Quality control reviews, on the other hand, are necessary to exercising professional skepticism as they serve to review or highlight errors and discrepancies to the auditor or other professional.

Reason I. The client’s requirements have changed
Reason II. There was a misunderstanding between the auditor and the client as to the nature of the services to be provided
Reason III. The engagement would uncover fraud
Reason IV. The client will not provide a signed representation letter

Reason IV is also not a valid reason, as compilations and reviews do not require signed representation letters.

A and B are incorrect because they do not account for the significant issues that arose. D is incorrect because the documentation should be sufficient to enable the auditor to understand the items mentioned.

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Generally, auditors are required to maintain audit working papers for a period of not less than one year from the later of the date the auditor&#39;s report is issued or the date on which the auditor&#39;s engagement is concluded. This practice corresponds with the AICPA&#39;s Statement on Auditing Standards No. 80, Audit Documentation, which recommends retaining working papers not less than one year. Further, AU-C 810 in the AICPA&#39;s Generally Accepted Auditing Standards refers to retaining the audit file for a minimum of one year. As such, the one-year requirement would be the most likely minimum retention period for the final audit file, making Choice B the best answer.

Question: A material weakness for a public company is a deficiency, or combinations of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a ________ that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be _________ on a timely basis.

Select the option that includes the correct answers for the blanks above.
A. Possibility; prevented or detected
B. Possibility; prevented, or detected and corrected
C. Reasonable possibility; prevented or detected
D. Reasonable possibility; prevented, or detected and corrected

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. Therefore, option D contains the correct answer for the blanks. Option C is similar but does not include the &#34;prevented, or detected and corrected&#34; phrase, making it a less likely answer. Option A is incorrect because it does not include the &#34;reasonable possibility&#34; phrase.

Question: Which of the following is not an element of quality control?
A. Client acceptance and continuance
B. Human resources
C. Monitoring
D. Profitability
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Quality control should encompass procedures that focus on the accuracy and completeness of the financial statements, according to the AICPA&#39;s Code of Professional Conduct. Profitability is related to a company&#39;s financial performance and not the accuracy of its financial statements, which is why choice D is not an element of quality control. Choices A and B are both related to quality control, and therefore less likely than Choice D.

Question: Which of the following statements regarding audit engagement planning is incorrect?
A. The engagement partner is responsible for the planning and performance of an engagement
B. Planning is a discrete phase of the audit
C. The auditor should establish an understanding of the terms of the engagement with the audit committee
D. The auditor should determine compliance with independence requirements

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The correct answer is D, as the auditor should determine compliance with independence requirements prior to the engagement, not during the planning phase. B is incorrect because the planning phase is not a discrete phase of the audit, but rather an ongoing process. A is incorrect because the engagement partner is responsible for the quality of the work performed rather than the planning and performance of the engagement.

Question: Which of the following statements regarding SOC for Service Organizations are correct?
I. SOC 1 reports are general use reports intended to be freely distributed
II. There are two types of SOC 2 reports
III. Both SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports relate to controls relevant to financial reporting
A. I only
B. II only
C. I and II
D. II and III

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports are intended to help service organizations inform users that their controls are relevant to the user&#39;s particular financial reporting framework. SOC 1 reports are designed for use by a business&#39;s management, auditors and other external users to assess the internal control of the entity. SOC 2 reports are designed for the business to provide assurance about its security, privacy, and confidentiality controls and processes. Answer C is the most likely choice because it references both SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports which are both related to controls relevant to financial reporting.

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Internal controls are not absolute and cannot guarantee a particular result. Inherently they are limited and may not be able to effectively manage control risks. Option A is true in that internal controls may be manual or automated. Option D is also true in that the effectiveness of their design and operation is a factor in control risk.

Question: The materiality level for the financial statements as a whole:

Second Choice: C 
Third Choice: D 
Explanation: The materiality level for financial statements as a whole typically is expressed as a range. This range can be determined either by the audit client or by the auditor (AICPA, 2020). Option A is incorrect because materiality levels are often not expressed as a specified amount, option D is incorrect because materiality levels do impact the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.

Tolerable misstatement is not expressed as a percentage but rather as a dollar amount.

Question: Which of the following factors should not be considered when determining the extent to which an engagement team can use the work of an internal auditor?
A. The internal auditor’s competence
B. The internal auditor’s objectivity

D. The risk of material misstatement related to the internal auditor’s assertions

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The independence of the internal auditor is not relevant to the engagement team&#39;s ability to use their work, so answering B would be incorrect. It is important to assess the internal auditor&#39;s competence and objectivity before using their work, so the correct answers for the other options are A and C. D is the best answer since the risk of material misstatement related to the internal auditor&#39;s assertions should be assessed when determining the extent of using their work.

Question: With respect to illegal acts committed by the audit client, the auditor is always responsible for:
A. Detecting and reporting material effects or misstatements of financial statement amounts resulting from those acts

Third Choice: C
Explanation: The auditor is responsible for detecting and reporting illegal acts by the company, and not just illegal acts that result in material misstatements of financial statement amounts (Choice A). It is also not the auditor&#39;s responsibility to determine whether or not the acts are illegal per se (Choice B) or to assure any contingent liabilities related to illegal acts are disclosed (Choice C).

Question: Accountants are responsible for considering laws and regulations to the extent that the laws and regulations:
A. Are generally recognized to have a direct and material effect on financial statement amounts
B. Relate more to the entity’s operations than finance or accounting
C. Apply to the personal non-business activities engaged in by the entity’s personnel
D. Are not applicable to the entity

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: B
Explanation: A is the correct response because laws and regulations have a direct and material effect on financial statement amounts. D is the second choice because laws and regulations do usually apply to the entity. B is the least likely response because laws and regulations are applicable to the entity&#39;s operations and finance or accounting, not the personal non-business activities of its personnel.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Option C is not an indication of management bias because it pertains to a change made to an accounting method due to new regulations. Option A references management’s selection of data that yield an estimate that is favorable for management objectives, which is an indication of management bias. Option B is also an indication of management bias because it references management’s selection of a point estimate that indicates a pattern of optimism. Option D references a change in accounting estimates based on management’s assertion of change in circumstances which may be an indication of management bias.

Question: If, after an audit report is issued, an auditor becomes aware of information that materially impacts the financial statements, the auditor should not:
A. Advise the client to issue revised financial statements
B. Advise the client to make appropriate disclosures and revise any imminent financial statements
C. Notify the client’s board of directors if management refuses to follow the appropriate procedures
D. Address the matter during the next audit

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: According to the AICPA Professional Standard 1001.01, the auditor should not remain silent in the face of a material misstatement after the issuance of the report. Option C is incorrect since the auditor cannot assume that it is the responsibility of the auditor to notify the client&#39;s board of directors. Option D is incorrect since the matter should be dealt with immediately and not wait until the next audit. Option A is incorrect since it is the client, not the auditor, who is responsible for issuing revised financial statements.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Choice D is not taken into account when an auditor forms an opinion because misstatements must be corrected before an opinion can be formed, and materiality decisions are not made by the auditor (AICPA, 2010). Choice A is taken into account when developing an opinion because audit evidence must be obtained before an opinion is formed (AICPA, 2010). Choice B is also taken into account when forming an opinion because an auditor has to determine whether the financial statements are in compliance with the applicable financial reporting framework (AICPA, 2010).

Explanation: Choice C is the most likely answer because when the materiality of the non-conformance with GAAP is material, the auditor should issue a qualified opinion. Choice B is incorrect because when the materiality of the non-conformance with GAAP is immaterial, the auditor should issue an unqualified opinion. Choice D is incorrect because a disclaimer of opinion is issued when the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base an opinion.

Question: When an auditor is unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence to support management’s assertions about presentation of a matter in the financial statements, this can be reflected in the audit report:
A. By expressing an unqualified opinion
B. By issuing an adverse opinion
C. By explaining the scope limitation in the notes of the financial statements
D. By disclaiming an opinion due to of a scope limitation
####

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The most probable course of action in this scenario is to explain the scope limitation in the audit report by providing necessary disclosure in the notes of the financial statements (Choice C). This way, the auditor can provide context regarding the inability to obtain sufficient audit evidence while not having to issue an adverse opinion (Choice B), which would cast doubt on the entire financial statements. A disclaimer of opinion due to a scope limitation (Choice D) would indicate that the auditor has simply not gathered enough evidence to form an opinion on the matter, which may not be the case here depending on the circumstances. An unqualified opinion (Choice A) can only be issued if sufficient evidence was obtained to support the assertions.

Question: If an auditor includes emphasis-of-matter paragraphs in the auditor’s report, they should not:

C. Include a reference to the matter being emphasized
D. Indicate that their opinion is not modified with respect to the matter emphasized

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Choice D is the most likely answer since including a reference to the matter being emphasized or referring to information presented outside of the financial statements could be viewed as a modification of the auditor’s opinion. Choice B is not incorrect, but “Emphasis of Matter” should not be the only heading used for the report.

Third Choice: D
Explanation: Statement I is correct, as the auditor has the ability to choose to issue a combined or separate report. Statement II is also correct, as a separate report must include an additional opinion paragraph following the opinion paragraph. Statement III is false, as an additional opinion paragraph is not added preceding the opinion paragraph in a report resulting from two separate reports.

Question: Which of the following is not a condition required for agreed-upon procedures attestation engagements?
A. Independence of the accountant, unless the practitioner is required by law or regulation to perform the engagement
B. A written assertion
C. The procedures to be applied are expected to result in reasonably consistent findings
D. If applicable, the accountant will apply the client’s established threshold for reporting exceptions

Third Choice: B
Explanation: In agreed-upon procedures engagements, independence of the accountant is essential for an opinion to be issued, as stated in AICPA Standard AT Section 120.07, whereas the threshold for reporting exceptions is not required for issuance of an opinion and therefore choice D is the most likely answer and A and B are incorrect.

Question: What type of report from a service auditor may provide the user auditor with evidence to reduce the assessed level of control risk?
A. Report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness
B. Report on controls placed in operation
C. Professional internal audit standards report
D. Report on control materiality

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: C
Explanation: The report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness is the most likely answer because the report provides evidence of control mechanisms and tests to measure if they have been followed. A report on controls placed in operation would provide evidence of the presence of controls, while a professional internal audit standards report provides evidence complying with relevant standards. A report on control materiality is not likely to provide evidence of the adequacy or effectiveness of internal controls as referenced.

Question: As part of a preparation engagement, all of the following should be considered, except:
A. Significant accounting policies intended to be used in the preparation

Third Choice: B
Explanation: The main objective of a preparation engagement is for an accountant to have sufficient knowledge to prepare financial statements which reflect the financial position of the organization. Therefore, the considerations should include significant accounting policies, identification of the applicable financial reporting framework, and the objective of the engagement. The accountant&#39;s independence does not necessarily have to be considered for a preparation engagement.

Question: Which of the following instances would not require an auditor to explicitly refer to consistency in the audit report?
A. When there is an adjustment to correct a material misstatement in previously issued financial statements
B. When a change in accounting principles has occurred, but is immaterial
C. When a change in accounting principles is accounted for by retrospective application and the audit report is for the period in which such change occurred
D. When an investment accounted for by the equity method makes a change in accounting principle that is material to the investing entity’s financial statements

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: An auditor does not have to explicitly refer to consistency in an audit report when a change in accounting principle is accounted for by retrospective application and the audit report is for the period in which such change occurred (choice C). Both instances when an adjustment for a material misstatement or a change in accounting principle has occurred and is material (choices A and D, respectively) would require explicit reference to consistency in the audit report.

Question: When engaged to give an opinion on whether supplementary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole, all of the following conditions must be met, except:
A. The auditor has issued an audit report on the financial statements that contains a disclaimer of opinion
B. The supplementary information relates to the same period as the financial statements
C. The supplementary information will be included with the audited financial statements or will be made readily available
D. The supplementary information was derived from, and relates directly to, the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financial statements

Third Choice: C
Explanation: The auditor&#39;s report on the financial statements must contain an explicit expression of opinion in order for the supplementary information to be fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

Question: An auditor could issue an unqualified opinion on financial statements prepared in conformity with which of the following non-GAAP methods?
A. Tax basis
B. Cash basis

D. A basis used to comply with the requirements of a governmental regulatory agency that has jurisdiction over the entity

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: An unqualified opinion means the auditor found that no material misstatements exist in the financial statements. Therefore, the statements must have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standards. An unqualified opinion cannot be issued on financial statements prepared on non-GAAP methods such as tax basis, cash basis, or criteria determined by management. However, an opinion can be issued on a financial statement prepared in a manner that complies with the an applicable regulatory agency&#39;s criteria.

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: The COSO ERM framework is composed of five components, which are control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. Option D (control activities) is already included in the framework and thus is not a valid option. Option C (review and revision) is not mentioned in the COSO ERM framework. Option A (governance and culture) is important for the framework, but does not directly appear in the framework.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation:The COSO ERM Framework identifies five components related to the management of compliance risks: (1) Control environment; (2) Risk assessment; (3) Control activities; (4) Information and communication; (5) Monitoring. Defining a risk appetite is not included in this list and is thus the correct choice. Formulate business objectives and Analyze business context are two of the framework&#39;s components.

A. External assessment
B. Control environment
C. Control activities
D. Monitoring
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The COSO Internal Control Framework consists of five components: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information, and Communication, and Monitoring. According to the COSO Framework, &#34;the control environment sets the tone of the organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure&#34; (COSO, 2013). Thus, A, B, and C are correct components of the COSO Internal Control Framework and D is incorrect, as it is not included.

Question: Which of the following is an example of a leading economic indicator?
A. Prime rate charged by banks
B. Industrial production
C. Index of consumer expectations
D. Average duration of unemployment
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Leading economic indicators are forward-looking economic data points that are used to predict the future of an economy. Industrial production reflects the actual productivity of the economy, making it a good indicator of economic performance. Consumer expectations and the prime rate charged by banks are both lagging indicators, so they are less useful in predicting an economy’s future. Average duration of unemployment is not typically used to predict an economy’s future performance.

Question: In a market structure with monopolistic competition, the barriers to entry are _____ and the long-run economic profit is ________.

Which of the following options correctly answers all of the blanks in the sentences above?

C. Low; positive
D. Low; zero

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Monopolistic competition is a market structure where there are many sellers who have some market power, meaning they can control the prices they charge, but there are few barriers to entry. Thus, the barrier to entry is low but there is still the ability to earn positive economic profits in the long-run, though they will eventually approach zero.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula is used to compute the required rate of return on a particular security. The formula requires the risk-free rate (A), the pre-tax cost of long-term debt (B), and the company’s beta coefficient (C) to calculate the required rate of return of a particular investment. The market risk premium (D) is not required as input in the CAPM formula and is not part of the formula, making it the correct answer.

Question: For which of the following areas would an accounting estimate be prepared?
A. Long-term debt
B. Cash
C. Wages
D. Goodwill impairment
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D 
Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: An accounting estimate is typically prepared in complex accounting areas that require significant judgment, such as determining the value of intangible assets (e.g. goodwill impairment as per FASB ASC 350) or recognizing accrued liabilities. Cash and wages are more straightforward and would not typically require an accounting estimate.

Question: All of the following factors should be considered when selecting a cloud computing service provider, except:
A. Whether the service provider undergoes an independent assessment of security and controls, such as a SOC 2 audit
B. Whether the service provider has service level agreements for uptime
C. The service provider’s depreciation method
D. The service provider’s physical controls

Third Choice: A
Explanation: The most relevant factors to consider when selecting a cloud computing service provider are A, B and D: A ensures the provider has the appropriate security, B ensures they can meet the customer&#39;s performance requirements and D ensures the provider has sufficient physical controls. C, however, does not relate to ensuring the security of the provider or performance standards - it instead relates to the accounting for the provider&#39;s property, plant and equipment.

Question: Inadequate change management processes and change controls could result in all of the following, except:
A. An unauthorized individual making changes to a production environment
B. Misclassification of data
C. A mismatch between the code and the documentation
D. Introduction of vulnerabilities

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: C
Explanation: Change management processes and change controls are intended to reduce the risk of an unauthorized individual making changes to a production environment (A), misclassification of data (B), and a mismatch between the code and the documentation (C). All of the options represent risks a change management or change control process should seek to mitigate or reduce. These processes, however, would not be designed to address introduction of vulnerabilities (D), which is outside the scope of their purpose.

Question: A network administrator’s failure to configure encryption on a new information system is an example of a:
A. Strategic risk
B. Operating risk
C. Financial risk
D. Information risk
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: An information risk is a type of risk associated with the accuracy and security of electronic information. In this example, the failure to configure encryption fails to protect the electronic information from unauthorized access and manipulation. Therefore, the most likely choice is D. Choice B is an operating risk which refers to risks associated with the regular operations of the organization, and Choice A is a strategic risk which refers to uncertainties about the organization&#39;s objectives.

Question: With respect to a data governance program, which of the following is not a valid practice related to customer data?
A. Reporting a data breach
B. Mapping the data throughout systems and applications
C. Classifying data by level of sensitivity
D. Storing unencrypted social security numbers
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Storing unencrypted social security numbers is not a valid practice related to customer data because it is considered a major security risk, and most companies have policies in place that prohibit it. Reporting a data breach and mapping the data throughout systems and applications are valid practices related to customer&#39;s data, while classifying data by level of sensitivity is also a valid practice, but it is not necessarily a required practice.

B. People-focused
C. Document-focused
D. Integration-focused

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Business Process Management is an approach that focuses on improving organizational performance by managing and optimizing an organization&#39;s business processes. Common philosophies include a “people-focused” approach, which emphasizes collaboration and engagement of stakeholders to achieve collective objectives. An “integration-focused” approach emphasizes the use of technology to improve process flow and customer experience. A “uniqueness-focused” approach emphasizes the personalized design of a business’s processes by understanding their distinct differentiators and capabilities. Document-focused does not fit into this list since it does not emphasize any of these aspects.

Question: ______ requires that public companies file their financial statements in ______.

Which of the following options correctly answers all of the blanks in the sentences above?
A. Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD); Excel
B. Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD); XBRL
C. Interactive Data Rule; Excel
D. Interactive Data Rule; XBRL
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: D
Second Choice: C
Third Choice: B
Explanation: Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) is related to the SEC&#39;s Fair Disclosure rule which requires that companies disclose information to the public concurrently and not selectively, meaning companies must make public disclosures and offer the same information to all investors at the same time. Neither Reg FD nor the Fair Disclosure rule requires public companies to file their financial statements. The Interactive Data Rule (also called the XBRL Rule) requires public companies to use eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) to submit disclosure documents including financial statements. Thus, the correct answer is D. Interactive Data Rule; XBRL.

Question: What technique allows users to examine how a model outcome changes when a model input changes?
A. Model differentiation
B. Simulation analysis
C. Sensitivity analysis
D. Outcome deviation

        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: C
Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Sensitivity analysis is a technique which allows users to examine how a model outcome changes when a model input changes. Simulation analysis is similar in that it is used to test assumptions and analyze outcomes for different scenarios, but does not specifically explore the sensitivity of a model. Model differentiation involves observing the changes in a model output given the changes in inputs, but does not measure the sensitivity of those changes. Outcome deviation is not related to the topic.

Question: Which technique is intended to convert input data into a unique representation of the data?
A. Scrambling
B. Hashing
C. Encryption
D. Dicing
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B. Hashing 
Second Choice: C. Encryption 
Third Choice: A. Scrambling
Explanation: Hashing is intended to take an input of any length and produce a unique, fixed length output. Encryption is intended to take an input of any length and produce an output that is a function of the input, but is not necessarily unique. Scrambling is not related to the conversion of data, but instead is intended to conceal the original data&#39;s meaning. Dicing is a type of data manipulation technique, but not related to the conversion of data in this question.

A. Rental income
B. Depreciation
C. Wages
D. Net exports
####
</p>
        <h5>Response:</h5>
        <pre style="color: #000000; background-color: rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05); white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5em;">First Choice: B
Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given period. Rental income, wages, and net exports are all components of GDP, while depreciation is not. Depreciation measures the loss in value of an asset over time due to wear, tear, or obsolescence, and as such, is not included in GDP.

Question: When do cost leadership strategies fail?
A. In markets where buyers have significant bargaining power
B. In markets with heavy price competition
C. When consumers desire improvements over low costs
D. When the consumers’ cost to switching products is low

Second Choice: B
Third Choice: A
Explanation: Cost leadership strategies can fail when consumers desire improvements over low costs (Choice C). Price competition (Choice B) can reduce profits and cost leadership strategies, but is not necessarily the cause of failure. Bargaining power (Choice A) can also reduce profits, but it is not necessarily the cause of cost leadership strategies failing. Similarly, low cost to switch products (Choice D) can reduce profits, but again is not necessarily the cause of failure.

Second Choice: A
Third Choice: D
Explanation: Rising interest rates generally result in an appreciation of the currency due to an increase in investors&#39; demand for the currency. This increase in demand decreases the relative value of a currency (Choice A), while an increase in the relative value of a currency (Choice B) results. Both options C and D do not have a direct relationship with rising interest rates.

Third Choice: D
Explanation: Diversifiable risk (also known as &#34;unsystematic risk&#34;) is the portion of a single asset&#39;s risk that is associated with random causes and can be eliminated through diversification. Choice A is incorrect because diversifiable risk is unrelated to market factors. Choice D is incorrect because diversifiable risk is not the same as systematic risk.

Explanation: Treasury stock consists of shares that have been issued and repurchased by the company (C). option D is close but refers to shares that have been purchased by shareholders rather than the company itself. Option A is not correct as treasury stock would not be authorized but not yet issued since it has been repurchased.

Second Choice: D
Third Choice: A
Explanation: An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term debt instruments bear higher interest rates than longer-dated ones. This indicates a decrease in economic growth and may precede a recession. A expanding yield curve occurs when long-term debt instruments bear higher interest rates than short-term ones. This indicates economic expansion and is the opposite of an inverted yield curve. Therefore the most likely answer is C, followed by D, and least likely A.

Second Choice: A 
Third Choice: C 
Explanation: When price elasticity of demand is inelastic, it means that the demand for the good or service is not sensitive to price changes. Therefore, as the price decreases, the total revenue stays the same. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer as total revenue does not change and price decreases. 
Choice A is incorrect as total revenue does not change when price increases.
Choice C is incorrect as total revenue does not increase when price increases.
Choice D is incorrect as total revenue does not decrease when price increases.

Second Choice: C
Third Choice: D
Explanation: A control chart is a graphical representation of desired limits for how a given process varies. Option A is most accurate as it references mean quality, which is commonly used in control charts, as well as day which is an appropriate unit of measure. Option C references variance of activity, which is also an appropriate measure but it&#39;s paired with region which is not typically used as a unit of measure, while Option D pairs total production with department, which are both inappropriate measures for a control chart.

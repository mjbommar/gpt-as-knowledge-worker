Factor II states that the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset and is reasonably certain to do so.

Lastly, Factor IV states that the present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residuals value guaranteed by the lessee not already included in the lease payments, is substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.

The Interactive Data Rule (also called the XBRL Rule) requires public companies to use eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) to submit disclosure documents including financial statements.
